# CIMT (Campus Incident Management Tool) App
For our Pasadena City College final Full-stack Web Development Certificate project, our 3-person team developed an app utilizing React, Node, Express, and MySQL.\

The app is an incident management system which, after user login, allows the user to:
- add new campus emergency resources,
- report a new emergency incident,
- search all available resources by keyword and other criteria,
- generate a resource report showing emergency resources owned by the logged-in user.

**MySQL database required.**

## Prior to Launch:

- Add `node_modules` to server-level and client-level directories.
- Run `npm update` in both directories.
- Build MySQL database using files in *MySQL_dB_Setup* folder (see README.md file).

## To Launch App:

In the server-level directory, run `npm run dev`.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Server: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\
Client: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

## Planning Docs:
The *Planning_Docs* folder contains the database entity relationship diagram, as well as our report detailing the app's information flow: task decompositions, abstract code, data types, and business constraints.
